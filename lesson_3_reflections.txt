When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

You would want to use a remote repository if you would like to keep a remote
backup, want to work on your files from a different location/computer or if 
you want to have multiple people working on the same project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You would want to pull changes manually because your remote and local
repositories might be alternate between being the most up-to-date. If your
local repository is most up-to-date, then you wouldn't want to pull
automatically. Instead, you would want to push it.
