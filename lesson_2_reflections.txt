What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, it sets up to be able to do version control
with Git. It creates the hidden .git folder that holds all the metadata. You
need to do it to be able to use all the version control features we discussed.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains all the files you wish to commit to your repository.
The working directory is the directory where you are editing and making changes
to your files. It provides the value of having granular control over which files
to commit. As discussed earlier, it's ideal to have a commit for every logical
change, allowing to also include a commit message. By having an staging area, it
allows us to have this when we edit multiple files between commits.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can use the staging area as well as commands such as git diff and git diff
--staged to compare the staging area with the most recent commit. You can use
these commands to compare the differences in files to ensure that you only have
logical change per commit.
